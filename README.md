# :sparkles: The Orion programming language
What is intended to be a strongly-typed compile language. With the goal to be generating assembly 
(or transpile to C in the early days, who knows, I haven't written the code generator yet)

## :boom: Getting the project started
During the early stages I'll be creating examples of what I want the language to look like, and 
hopefully from there generate an EBNF form of the language.

**Examples:**
- [generic main.ori file](./examples/main.ori)
